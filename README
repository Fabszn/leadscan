# Devoxx LeadTracker

Lead tracker back-end application

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Devoxx LeadTracker is written in Scala and uses the [Lagom](https://www.lightbend.com/lagom) framework. You need to install several tools.

#### Scala

```
$ brew install scala  
$ scala -version
Scala code runner version 2.12.1 -- Copyright 2002-2016, LAMP/EPFL and Lightbend, Inc.
```

#### SBT

[SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org) is the Scala build tool. Check the [documentation](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/).

```
$ brew install sbt  
$ sbt about
[info] This is sbt 0.13.11
```

#### Intellij IDEA

If you use [Intellij IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) IDE you will need to install the Scala plugin to be able to develop.

* Scala and SBT Plugin : check the [page](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.3/creating-and-running-your-scala-application.html) and download/install the [plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/?idea&id=1347) directly from the IDE

Then install the Scala SDK in Intellij IDEA

### Installing

Once you have all the code, you can run the following command :

```
sbt runAll
```

This will compile all the code, and deploy it on several servers. Just check you have access to the following URLs: 

* [http://localhost:8000/services]() : access the gateway API
* [http://localhost:9000]() : access a MOCK web interface
